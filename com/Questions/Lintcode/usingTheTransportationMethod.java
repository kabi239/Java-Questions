/*
    3300 Â· Using the Transportation Method
    Description:
    Topic requirements:
    Define a class of vehicle with properties: 
        speed (speed), volume (size), acceleration (acceleration), time (time).
    Define some methods: 
        move: output content for the initial speed, acceleration and volume, 
        setSpeed(): can set the initial speed of the vehicle and print, 
        speedUp: speed plus acceleration times time and print, 
        speedDown: speed minus acceleration times time and print, If the speed is less than 0, the output is 0.
    Instantiate a vehicle object, initialize the values of speed and 
    size by methods and call the methods to print the output; in addition, 
    call speedUp and speedDown to change the speed.
